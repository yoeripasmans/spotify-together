## Problem

We both had the problem that there isn’t any solution right now for a synchronized playlist together with other people. Spotify themselves have their ‘collaborative playlists’ only then everyone had their own version of the playlist and everyone can play it separately. We wanted something synchronized, easily accessible where the opinion of the users counted.

## Concept

So we came up with Spotify Together. It’s an synchronized playlist where everyone can easily join in and add their favorite songs. Next, people can like songs they “like” to get them higher up the queue.

Spotify Together can be used both by small groups of friends or by businesses. In this case the business setting up their own playlist can change the restrictions so the songs being added to the playlist are monitored. How much freedom you give the users is completely up to the creators of the playlists.

## Café Fest

And to change it up a bit, we pitched the concept to Café Fest which they really liked and they want to use our product when it’s finished. This also means I’m mostly focusing on the context within Café Fest and haven’t worked out the complete product. Otherwise the project would’ve become too big.

After a couple of meetings with Café Fest we noticed Spotify Together could be ideally used when Fest hosts special events. Let’s say Fest is throwing a disco party. They create their playlist, give it a suiting name, and add a restircction that only disco songs are allowed. That’s it. The playlist is made and can be casted to a beamer / monitor.

Next the guests walk into Fest, they see the beamer / monitor and know they can join the playlist. They scan the shown QR code and they are in. Now they can add they favorite songs and like songs to get them higher up the queue.
